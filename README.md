# TMC2130 SB

The TM2130 SB is a stepper motor driver based on the advanced TMC 2130 driver.

The TMC2130 SB is a derived work from the Silent Step Stick https://github.com/watterott/SilentStepStick. We rewrote the project using kicad, with some improvements, like the potentiometer on the upper side. This is a 4 layer board with improved heat dissipation.

* Full compatible with Pololu a4988 and DRV8825
* Compatible with SPI mode
